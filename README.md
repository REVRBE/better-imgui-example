# better-imgui-example

An external Windows application using ImGui to render our content. I was bored so I made this, it works flawless and can easily be re-purposed to whatever your project needs. 

Handles window resizing and movement without freezing the rendering. 

Easy font and style initialization with barebone examples provided.

NB: Dark mode via DWM API might not work on Windows 11
